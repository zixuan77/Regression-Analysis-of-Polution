# Regression-Analysis-of-Polution


By now it is widely recognized that air quality impacts health, but this was not always the case. The file `pollution.csv` contains data from an early observational study investigating the relationship between specific pollutants and mortality in U.S. cities. Variable descriptions and units are recorded in the metadata file `pollution-metadata.csv`. All measurements were taken for the period 1959 - 1961.

In this data the presence of pollutants is reported as *relative pollution potential*, which is calculated by scaling emissions (tons per day per square kilometer) by a dispersion factor based on local conditions (mixing, wind, area, and the like).

The Rmd file includes a series of regression analysis on the association between mortality rates and pollutants.
